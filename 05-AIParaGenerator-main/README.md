# AI Paragraph Writer

> This is the **fifth final project** I made for finishing my **Codedex journey**:  
It is an **AI model** using OpenAI that returns responses to prompts like:  
*"Write a paragraph about the following topic:"* and asks whether you want it to write another one, continuing until you answer anything other than "yes".
